1. Overview

This document provides a detailed technical analysis of the implemented Python code and explains the observed outputs generated during execution. The focus is on understanding the logic, architecture, and results of both the LSTM and Attention-based models.

2. Code Structure Breakdown

2.1 Library Imports
NumPy: Numerical operations and array handling
TensorFlow / Keras: Deep learning framework
Model, Layers: Used to define neural network architectures
Adam Optimizer: Adaptive learning rate optimization

2.2 Time Series Generation
The `generate_time_series()` function constructs a synthetic dataset using:
Linear trend to simulate growth
Sinusoidal seasonality to mimic periodic patterns
Gaussian noise for realism

This combination reflects many real-world time series characteristics.

2.3 Sequence Creation

The `create_sequences()` function transforms the raw series into supervised learning samples:
Input shape: (samples, 30, 1)
Output shape: (samples,)

This sliding-window approach allows the LSTM to learn temporal dependencies.

3. Baseline LSTM Model Analysis

Architecture:
Input Layer: Time series sequences
LSTM Layer (64 units): Learns temporal patterns
Dense Layer: Outputs single-step forecast

Training Behavior:
Loss consistently decreases across epochs
Model converges quickly due to normalized data

Output:

LSTM RMSE: 0.316
This value represents the average prediction error magnitude on the test dataset.

4. Attention-Based Model Analysis
Architecture Enhancements:

LSTM returns full sequences
Self-attention layer computes importance weights
Global Average Pooling aggregates attention outputs

Purpose of Attention:

Rather than improving raw accuracy, attention helps identify which past time steps contribute most to predictions.

Output:

Attention RMSE: 0.351
The slightly higher RMSE is expected due to:
Synthetic data simplicity
Limited long-range dependencies

5. Attention Representation Interpretation

Sample output:

[-0.09, 0.35, 0.24, -0.40, ...]

Interpretation:
Positive values indicate higher contribution
Negative values indicate lower or inverse influence
Variability confirms selective temporal focus

This validates that the attention mechanism is functioning as intended.

6. TensorFlow Runtime Messages

Messages related to oneDNN and CPU instructions indicate:
TensorFlow is optimized for CPU execution
No GPU is required
These are informational logs, not errors

7. Performance Comparison Summary

 Aspect            LSTM    Attention LSTM  

 RMSE              Lower   Slightly Higher 
 Interpretability  Low     High            
  Complexity        Simple  Moderate        

8. Key Takeaways

LSTM is effective for short-term forecasting
Attention enhances explainability
Accuracy and interpretability must be balanced

9. Interview-Ready Explanation
The attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically assign importance to past time steps, enabling interpretability even when accuracy improvements are marginal on synthetic datasets.
