1. Introduction

Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as finance, energy consumption, traffic prediction, and demand forecasting. Traditional statistical models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies present in real-world data. Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven effective due to their ability to model long-term dependencies.

This project explores a baseline LSTM model and an enhanced LSTM model with an Attention mechanism to perform time series forecasting. The goal is not only to predict future values accurately but also to improve interpretability by understanding which past time steps influence predictions.

2. Objectives

Generate a realistic synthetic time series dataset
Build a baseline LSTM forecasting model
Implement an Attention-based LSTM model
Compare performance using RMSE
Demonstrate explainability using attention representations

3. Dataset Description

Since real-world datasets may contain noise, missing values, or access restrictions, a synthetic dataset was generated to simulate realistic conditions.
Dataset Components:
Trend: Linear upward movement over time
Seasonality: Periodic sinusoidal pattern
Noise: Gaussian noise to simulate randomness
The dataset consists of 12,000 time points and is normalized to improve neural network training stability.

4. Data Preprocessing

To convert the time series into a supervised learning problem:

A sliding window (lookback = 30) is used
Each input sample contains 30 consecutive time steps
The target is the next immediate value

The dataset is split into:
80% training data
20% testing data

5. Model Architecture

5.1 Baseline LSTM Model

The baseline model consists of:
Input layer (30 time steps, 1 feature)
LSTM layer with 64 hidden units
Dense output layer
This model serves as a benchmark for evaluating forecasting performance.

5.2 Attention-Based LSTM Model

The attention model enhances the LSTM by:

Returning full sequence outputs from the LSTM
Applying a self-attention mechanism to weigh time steps
Aggregating attention outputs using global average pooling

This architecture allows the model to focus on important historical time steps rather than treating all inputs equally.

6. Training Configuration

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Epochs: 5
Batch size: 64

7. Evaluation Metric

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used to evaluate model performance. RMSE provides an intuitive measure of prediction error in the same scale as the data.

8. Results

Model:Baseline LSTM
RMSE-0.316
Model:Attention LSTM
RMSE-0.351

Although the baseline LSTM achieves slightly lower RMSE, the attention model offers improved interpretability, which is a key objective of this project.

9. Explainability with Attention

The attention model produces a context vector representing the weighted contribution of past time steps. Sample attention values demonstrate that the model assigns different importance levels to different historical points, validating the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.

10. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates time series forecasting using LSTM and Attention mechanisms. While the baseline LSTM performs marginally better on synthetic data, the attention model provides valuable interpretability benefits. Such explainable models are particularly useful in real-world decision-making systems.

11. Future Enhancements

Apply the model to real-world datasets
Increase lookback window for long-term dependencies
Implement Transformer-based architectures
Visualize attention weights over time

12. Tools and Technologies

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
